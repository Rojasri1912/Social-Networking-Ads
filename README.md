# Social Networking Ads Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict user behavior on social networking ads using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that classifies whether a user will purchase a product based on given features such as age, estimated salary, and previous ad interaction.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Contains user demographics and ad interactions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and relationships.
- **Model Building**: Implementing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Plotting decision boundaries and performance metrics.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google Colab**: For coding and model training.
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization
  - `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms

## Installation & Usage
1. Open the project in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the dataset (if not using a public dataset).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess, train, and evaluate models.
4. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Expected Outcome
- A well-trained classification model that predicts user purchase decisions.
- Insights into key factors influencing ad conversion rates.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Deploying the model as a web app for real-time predictions.
- Integrating additional features such as user behavior patterns.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository, enhance the model, and submit pull requests with improvements.
